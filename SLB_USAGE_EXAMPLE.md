## Example Workflow

### Scenario: Investigating Load Balancer Configuration

1. **Start with SLB list**: `./tali` → Select "SLB Instances"
2. **Find your SLB**: Use `/` to search for "web-lb-prod"
3. **Check listeners**: Press `l` to see what ports are configured
4. **Check backend distribution**: Press `q` to go back, then `v` to view virtual server groups
5. **Inspect backend servers**: Select a VServer group and press Enter
6. **Copy configuration**: Use `yy` to copy server details for documentation

### Scenario: Troubleshooting Backend Server Issues

1. Navigate to SLB instances
2. Find the problematic load balancer
3. Press `v` to view virtual server groups
4. Select the relevant VServer group
5. Press Enter to see backend servers
6. Check server IDs, ports, and weights
7. Use `yy` to copy server information for further investigation

## Advanced Features

### Profile Switching
- Press `O` (uppercase O) from anywhere to switch between different Alibaba Cloud profiles
- Useful when managing multiple accounts or regions

### Error Handling
- If API calls fail, you'll see user-friendly error messages
- Network issues are handled gracefully
- Invalid selections are prevented

## Tips and Best Practices

1. **Use search frequently**: Large SLB deployments can have many instances - use `/` to quickly find what you need

2. **Copy before modifying**: Use `yy` to copy current configurations before making changes elsewhere

3. **Navigate efficiently**: Learn the key bindings (`l`, `v`, `q`) for quick navigation

4. **Check all levels**: Don't forget to check both listeners (`l`) and virtual server groups (`v`) for complete understanding

5. **Use profiles**: If managing multiple environments, set up different profiles and use `O` to switch between them

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"No SLB instances found"**
- Check your Alibaba Cloud credentials
- Verify you're in the correct region
- Ensure your account has SLB permissions

**"Failed to fetch listeners/groups"**
- The SLB instance might not have listeners or virtual server groups configured
- Check API permissions for SLB operations

**Navigation not working**
- Make sure you're using lowercase `l` and `v` keys
- Ensure you've selected a row before pressing navigation keys

### Getting Help
- All views support the standard help keys
- Press `?` in most views for context-sensitive help
- Check the main documentation for detailed API information
